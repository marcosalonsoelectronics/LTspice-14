In this video we see how to implement several blocks for digital control. Particularly: zero-order-hold block, n-bit A/D converter, digital ramp generator, digital sine generator, digital PWM, 1 sample period delay block (z^-1), and 1 to 3 sample period delay block. We also show a simulation example of digital control of a buck converter exactly as it is done from a microcontroller or a DSP.
